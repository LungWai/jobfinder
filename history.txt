> Plan accordingly with history.txt, i do not need extra agentic feature, but only some management 
  usage. Please review the text and codebase and see the plan implementation with multi agent

● I'll analyze the history.txt file and the codebase to understand your multi-agent plan implementation
  needs for management usage.

● Read(history.txt)
  ⎿  Read 419 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now let me examine the current state of the project to understand what has been implemented and what
  remains:

● Task(Review project structure)
  ⎿  Interrupted by user

> No need agent features for the application, instead divide the tasks into different sub-modules with 
  multi-agent for implementation. You can keep the multi-agent feature for future works. But now 
  implement the code project with multi agent

● I understand. You want me to create a plan for implementing the remaining tasks using multiple agents
  working in parallel, but without adding AI/agent features to the application itself. Let me analyze
  what needs to be completed and create a multi-agent implementation plan.

● Task(Analyze remaining tasks)
  ⎿  Done (10 tool uses · 22.3k tokens · 2m 29.3s)                                                      

● Now I'll create a comprehensive multi-agent implementation plan that divides the remaining tasks into
  parallel work streams that can be executed by different agents simultaneously.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Agent 1: Database & Infrastructure Setup - PostgreSQL migration, Redis setup, directory creation
     ☐ Agent 2: Email & Notification Services - Nodemailer config, email templates, notification system
     ☐ Agent 3: Job Queue & Background Tasks - Bull queue setup, job processors, scheduling

●User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿ Multi-Agent Implementation Plan for Job Finder Completion

    I've analyzed the project and created a comprehensive plan to complete all remaining features using 
    a multi-agent approach. The work will be divided among 12 specialized agents working in parallel:

    High Priority Agents (Start Immediately)

    Agent 1: Database & Infrastructure
    - Complete PostgreSQL migration with enhanced schema
    - Setup Redis for caching and job queues
    - Create required directories (/uploads, /logs)
    - Configure Docker containers

    Agent 2: Email & Notification Services
    - Configure Nodemailer with SMTP
    - Create email templates (verification, reminders, alerts)
    - Implement notification queue system
    - Add email service integration to existing routes

    Agent 3: Job Queue & Background Tasks
    - Setup Bull queue for background processing
    - Create job processors for scraping, emails, reminders
    - Implement retry logic and error handling
    - Add job monitoring dashboard

    Agent 5: Frontend Authentication
    - Build Login/Register components
    - Implement password reset flow
    - Setup JWT token management
    - Create protected route guards

    Agent 6: Application Dashboard
    - Create application list view with filters
    - Build application detail pages
    - Implement status tracking UI
    - Add timeline visualization

    Agent 10: API Client Services
    - Create Axios service layer
    - Setup request/response interceptors
    - Implement error handling
    - Add loading state management

    Medium Priority Agents

    Agent 4: WebSocket Real-time
    - Setup Socket.io server
    - Create event handlers for notifications
    - Implement client-side WebSocket connection
    - Add real-time status updates

    Agent 7: Interview Management UI
    - Build calendar view for interviews
    - Create scheduling interface
    - Add preparation checklists
    - Implement reminder settings

    Agent 8: Document Management UI
    - Create file upload interface
    - Add document preview functionality
    - Implement version management
    - Build document association UI

    Agent 9: User Profile & Settings
    - Design profile editor interface
    - Add skills/preferences management
    - Create notification settings
    - Build saved searches UI

    Low Priority Agents

    Agent 11: Scheduled Tasks
    - Setup node-cron for scheduled jobs
    - Configure daily scraping runs
    - Implement reminder dispatching
    - Add job alert system

    Agent 12: Testing & Integration
    - Write E2E tests for critical flows
    - Add API integration tests
    - Create UI component tests
    - Setup CI/CD pipeline

    Implementation Strategy

    1. Parallel Execution: All high-priority agents can start simultaneously
    2. Service Dependencies: Agents 2-3 provide services needed by others
    3. Frontend Integration: Agents 5-10 work together on UI components
    4. Progressive Enhancement: Medium priority agents add advanced features
    5. Quality Assurance: Agent 12 validates all implementations

    Expected Outcomes

    - Complete job application management system
    - Real-time notifications and updates
    - Automated reminders and follow-ups
    - Professional document management
    - Robust background job processing
    - Comprehensive user dashboard

    This multi-agent approach ensures efficient parallel development while maintaining code quality and 
    system integrity.

● Now I'll start implementing the plan with multiple agents working in parallel. Let me begin by marking
   the high-priority tasks as in-progress and start the implementation.

● Update Todos

  ⎿  Done (38 tool uses · 32.9k tokens · 30m 34.1s)                                                     

● Excellent! Agent 1 has completed the infrastructure setup. Let me update the todo and start the next
  high-priority agents in parallel:
