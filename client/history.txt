> Based on history.txt, continue on the project.

● I'll analyze the project history and continue working on the Hong Kong Job Finder application. Let me
  first check the current state of the project and see what needs to be done.

● Read(../history.txt)
  ⎿  Read 241 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me check the current state of the project structure to understand what has been implemented:

● Bash(find . -type f -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" | grep -E
      "(server|client/src)" | sort)
  ⎿  ./client/src/App.tsx               
     ./client/src/components/JobCard.tsx
     ./client/src/components/Layout.tsx
     … +49 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me check which tasks remain to be completed based on the TODO list:

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Agent 7: Interview Management UI - Calendar, scheduling, reminders, preparation tools
     ☐ Agent 8: Document Management UI - Upload interface, file preview, versioning
     ☐ Agent 9: User Profile & Settings - Profile editor, preferences, notifications config
     ☐ Agent 12: Testing & Integration - End-to-end tests, API tests, UI tests

● Based on the history, I can see that Agents 1-6, 10, and 11 have been completed. Let me continue with
  the remaining agents. I'll start by implementing Agent 7 (Interview Management UI):
