● Project Status Summary

  Hong Kong Job Finder is a comprehensive job aggregation platform with the following status:

  ✅ Completed Features

  - Backend API with Express.js, authentication, and comprehensive routing
  - Database Schema with 20+ models for jobs, applications, interviews, and user management
  - Web Scrapers for JobsDB, Recruit.com.hk, CT Good Jobs, and university boards
  - Frontend React app with job listings, application tracking, and interview management
  - Security JWT auth, rate limiting, input validation, and security headers
  - Infrastructure Docker setup for PostgreSQL, Redis, and pgAdmin

  ⚠️ Immediate Issues

  1. Missing Dependencies: Backend packages not installed (run npm install)
  2. Frontend Dependencies: Installed and ready

  📋 Next Steps

  1. Install backend dependencies: npm install
  2. Set up environment variables: Copy .env.example to .env
  3. Start Docker services: docker-compose up -d
  4. Initialize database: npm run db:push
  5. Run development server: npm run dev

  The project architecture is solid with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive data models, and
  security measures. Once dependencies are installed and environment configured, it should be ready for
  development.

> First check the codebase and verify each modules completeness, check the connection between    │
  │   modules as well. Then check on the docuementation and delete outdated, clumsy documentation.   │
  │   Refine the documentation so the developer can catch up with ease. Please clear the hitory.txt  │
  │   as well

● I'll thoroughly review the codebase to check module completeness, connections, and clean up the
  documentation.
